## What is Easy NPS ?
Easy NPS is a tool that makes filling online surveys easier for customers. Because customer service is something every company cares about, getting relevant data sometimes can seem quite impossible since the collected sample number is way off the realistic one. The goal of Easy NPS is to make it easier for customers to fill any experience based survey so that the sample number increases leading to a more accurate data analysis.
